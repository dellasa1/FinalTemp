Password Generator

This program is quite simple. When you need a place to generate or store passwords, this application lets you do so. The program will let you enter a few words and a number, and will generate a simple, but relatively secure password. The program will display some options that let you choose how you want to change your passwords, whether you want to delete, add, or view your passwords. In this way you will be able to choose how you manipulate what passwords are stored in the file that is used in the application.
